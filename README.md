# On the Care and Feeding of the Unusual Red-Crested Developer <br/><br/> (Or: Josh - the User Manual)

## Environments I like to work in

### Good
- Quiet
- Natural light
- Several 4k screens
- A *good* office chair
    - I have back problems, a good chair is essential.
    - I have an Aeron chair at home, which has worked very well for me for the past 8 years.
- A mouse and keyboard of my choice
- Mac (preferred) or Linux
- Noise cancelling headphones
- A supply of good quality tea and/or coffee
- Snacks

### Bad
- Noisy
- Hot desking (I need a space that's *mine*).

## How I like to structure my time

### Good
- Unfragmented. I like long blocks of time to work on a task.
- If I need to have meetings, I prefer to have them at the start or end of the day, or straight after lunch.
- If I need to have a *lot* of meetings, I prefer to have them all on one day, so I can have the rest of the week to work uninterrupted.

### Bad
- Lots of small meetings throughout the day, that don't allow enough time to deeply get into a task.

## Communication

In order of preference:

1. **Slack (or similar written, async tools)**
  - I like to be able to read messages when I'm at a convenient break in work, and have time to think about my response.
  - I prefer most messages to be in open channels by default, rather than DMs, so that others can benefit from the conversation.
2. **In person** - particularly 1:1 or in a small group.
  - Ideally with a whiteboard and/or a pile of sticky notes.
  - Comes with the caveat that I work remotely, so opportunities for in person collaboration are limited.
3. **Zoom & Miro (or similar)**.
  - The next best thing to a whiteboard and sticky notes.
  - I benefit a lot from having a visual representation of ideas when I'm having a conversation.
4. **Email**
  - I don't like email, but I'll use it when necessary.
5. **Large group meetings (in person or virtual)**
  - The larger the group, the less likely I am to feel comfortable contributing.
6. **Phone**
  - Don't call me unless the servers are on fire, or something equally dire.

## Preferred ways to receive feedback
- Regularly, and close to the time that triggered the feedback.
- Written, with a follow up discussion if necessary.
- Make the point clearly and explicitly, with minimal sugar coating. Still be kind and empathetic, of course.
- Use concrete examples, rather than generalities.
- If action is needed, be clear about what the action or desired outcome is.

## Things I need
- Psychological safety.
- A sense of belonging and being included in a team.
- Clear expectations.
- Quiet, alone time.

## How I learn best
- Doing the thing I'm trying to learn.
- Reading the documentation cover-to-cover. (This is surprisingly effective).

## Team dynamics that work well for me
- I work much more effectively when I have people to collaborate with. Not just in a "check in / get some guidance" sense, but in a "working on the same problem at the same time" sense.
- I've generally found small groups (3-4 people) who I'm consistently working with across multiple tasks/projects to be most effective for me.
- Conversely, I do *not* like working alone for long periods of time. I need people to bounce ideas off, and to pull me up if I get off track.
- I also need people that I work with closely and consistently enough that I get socially comforable with them, and vice-versa.

## Things I love
- Refactoring, and cleaning up code.
- Continuously improving anything I'm working on, (including myself).
- Lego
- Books (sci-fi and fantasy, mostly).
  - You should read Discworld. It's amazing.
- Creative writing.
- Cooking.
- Board games and video games. Particularly strategy games.
- Functional programming
  - I will talk your ear off about Haskell if you let me.

## Things I struggle with
- Large group settings, particularly with people I don't know.
- Too much socialising.
- Small talk.
  - Please don't send me Slack messages that are just "Hi, how are you?". They just make me anxious.
- Noisy environments.
- Too many things competing for my attention at once.

## Other quirks and idiosyncrasies
- I will sometimes build Lego kits in meetings - particularly meetings where I only have to listen & talk. This is not me being rude / disengaged / not paying attention. In fact, I'm probably paying far *more* attention than I would otherwise.
- My communication can sometimes come off as abrupt, blunt, or sarcastic. This is *usually* not intended. If you want me to change how I communicate, please tell me, and be specific and direct about what you want me to change.
- I have a tendency to get stuck down technical rabbit holes - particularly on problems that I find interesting, or where a solution is something I think is hard but *possible*. This is not always the best use of my time. If you think I'm stuck down a rabbit hole, please tell me.
- I've found I have a different approach to programming and problem solving compared to a lot of developers. If you're familiar with George R.R. Martin's concept of "gardeners vs architects", I fall firmly into the "gardener" camp. I start with something very rough, functional, and not particularly planned out, and then I improve it over time as I learn what can and should be improved. This often means that if you ask me how something is going to work, I can't give you a clear answer, because I haven't tried doing it yet. Conversely, this often results in me doing the thing you asked, *and* improving five other things that I noticed while doing it, which is usually beneficial long term.
- If it's not obvious from the rest of this, yes I am neurodivergent.

## Things I won't do
- Overnight on-call duties. I am not going to wake up at 3am because the server had a hiccup.
- Commute regularly to an office. I'm happy to come in for specific events, but I'm not going to do the X-days-per-week commute, for any value of X >= 1.
